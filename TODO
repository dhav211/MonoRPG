Tasks:
    X1. When player clicks on a dead enemy or chest a menu will open allowing player to select items they wish to take
        - when chest is empty a text box will open saying that it is empty.
        - when dead enemy is empty, then nothing will happen.
    
    X2. Create a locked chest which requires a key to unlock.
        - a message will open saying which key it requires. At bottom of box it will say Close and Unlock. If player has key it will say Unlock if he doesnt
            it wont.
    
    3. Change camera movement. Right now it just freely moves when mouse is near edge of screen. I want a clamp on how far it can move from player. Also
        it won't be able to move by edge of screen but only when player holds the C key
    
    4. Skills. Two basic skills and the rest can be extended from there. Fireball and Molotov
        - First start with skill bar at the bottom. This will show a picture of skill and cool down number if cooling down.

        -Fireball
        - This will form a line from where player clicks, it will check if there are any collisions with walls.
        - The fireball will tween to collision point (usually entity)
        - once tween is finished it will calculate damage to entity and disappear
        - proceed to next turn.

        -Molotov
        -Similar, create line check for entities.
        - Main difference is it will damage and area. Use flood fill to check for entities and calculate damage.
    
    X5. Create keyboard movement for menus.
        - Hightlighted text buttons will turn yellow instead of it's usual white
    
    6. Add some better functionality to the Enemy Stat Popup menu.
        - It should close when another menu opens.
        - When enemy takes some damage and the menu is open, then update it. A signal will take care of this.
            - On the take damage component, it will emit a signal when Health is changed. The enemy stat popup can connect to this signal when created.
            It will also be needed when player health bars are created
    
    7. Show health bars at bottom of screen, above skill slots.


    Cooldown.
    - Once skill is used, in the skill class set it's current cool down to it's cooldown period.
    - Make the cooldown cover and cooldown period label invisible.
    - Connect the skills with the players on turn started signal.
    - When that signal is emitted, the let the countdown drop for the skills.
    - There will be a signal in the skills called CooldownFinished, which will emit and inform the skill button that it can be used again.
    - There will be another signal in the skills called SkillUsed, which will emit and inform the skill button that it can't be used.
    - When the SkillUsed is emitted, make the cooldown cover and cool down label invisible.
    - When CooldownFinished is emitted, make the cooldown cover and label visible again.
    - These signals will also control a bool in the SkilButton called isCoolingdown, which allows button to be pressed.
