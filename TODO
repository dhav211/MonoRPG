Tasks:
    1. Fix crash when player clicks to move to dead enemy.
    2. In test dungeon scene, create a two chest variables, then use the entity manager to set those chests, this will be a somewhat dumb method right now
        basically looping thru them and checking the chest_id variable. While this is happening, put the required items within.
        - This will become the basis for most of the scene creation, since objects are quite limited in ogmo, this will have to make due.
    3. When player walks up to chest and opens it, remove all items from chest and add to inventory, there will be one big list with all items. and then seperate
        lists with them sorted.
    4. Start work on that inventory buddy

    Change how the interaction component works. Right now it works off enums. I think I change that into a dictionary<string, delegate>. So the player interaction
    script can pull from that and avoid a lot of messy if statements in the future. The first interaction will be the main of course

if you change distros and this doesn't work you might rely on dotnet-sdk-3.1 version 3.1.302
