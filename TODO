Tasks:
    1. Fix crash when player clicks to move to dead enemy.
    2. Start work on inventory.
        - Create a few simple items, like a potion, magic herbs, antidote, and a key.
        - Create a few weapons and armors.
        - Naturally include all stats for these items
        - Also make a simple icon to be displayed for the item.
    3. Have the chests open and containing items. One chest will be locked and require a key. Also items can be removed from dead enemies.
        - These will both have the same menu for removing items.
    4. Start thinking how inventory will work. Will it be classic list style, or will it be more of limited space like in resident evil games.
