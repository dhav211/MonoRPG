Tasks:
    X1. Lighting - Lets save this for later, learn about shaders first. Good luck buddy.
    X2. Equipment
    3. Player Stats Menu
        - A fairly simple menu that will just tell you your HP, stats, experience, and whatever aliments you may have.
    4. Equipment Menu
        - This will be a bit more complicated of a menu that will involve multiple popup menus and whatnot.
        - When menu is initially opened it will have buttons for all the equipment.
            - Each button will be named after the name of the equipment.
            - This will check the players equipment and create the button names from whats equipped
            - To the left of the button will be a label that says the position it's equipped (R. Hand, Head, etc)
        - On the right side of this menu will show the stats of the equpment, the stats it changes and a description of the equipment.
        - When button is clicked it will popup another menu which will display a list like the inventory. Each one will be a button.
        - When the button is clicked, then the player will equip that item.
        - Much like the main equipment menu, on the right side it will show the same stats.
        - In the stat section, the stats will be color coded. If the stat increases then it will be green, if lowers red, if the same white
