Tasks:
    X1. When player clicks on a dead enemy or chest a menu will open allowing player to select items they wish to take
        - when chest is empty a text box will open saying that it is empty.
        - when dead enemy is empty, then nothing will happen.
    
    X2. Create a locked chest which requires a key to unlock.
        - a message will open saying which key it requires. At bottom of box it will say Close and Unlock. If player has key it will say Unlock if he doesnt
            it wont.
    
    3. Change camera movement. Right now it just freely moves when mouse is near edge of screen. I want a clamp on how far it can move from player. Also
        it won't be able to move by edge of screen but only when player holds the C key
    
    4. Skills. Two basic skills and the rest can be extended from there. Fireball and Molotov
        - First start with skill bar at the bottom. This will show a picture of skill and cool down number if cooling down.

        -Fireball
        - This will form a line from where player clicks, it will check if there are any collisions with walls.
        - The fireball will tween to collision point (usually entity)
        - once tween is finished it will calculate damage to entity and disappear
        - proceed to next turn.

        -Molotov
        -Similar, create line check for entities.
        - Main difference is it will damage and area. Use flood fill to check for entities and calculate damage.
    
    5. Create keyboard movement for menus.
        - Hightlighted text buttons will turn yellow instead of it's usual white
