Tasks:
    UI.
    -Components-
    X1. Nine slice sprite.
    X2. Label
    X3. Button (Text, Texture, TextureAndText)

    -Entities-
    X1X. Damage indication. A number that appears briefly above and entity's head when damaged.
    X1. Simple text box that is composed of a nine splice sprite, label, and a text button at bottom that closes text box.

    -Debug Console-
    Prints debug messages to a text box which is activated by pressing F1

    -UI Entity Manager-
    This will work quite similarly to the usual Entity system. A bit more convulted in its draw system but not as complicated overall.
    Since different UI components require different sprite batches (Text and GUI for example), this is where things will get more convulted.
